1. Create a simple contact list application.
 A user should be able to :

        - addContact
        - removeLast
        - findContact
        - removeContact

        - updateContactInfo
        - showAllContacts

        - showFirstFiveContacts
        - showLastFiveContacts

        - showLifeContacts
        - showKiyvstarContacts

        - add a phoneNumber number validation
 - Create a ContactListRun class with the main method containing examples of working code or create JUnit  tests ( for those who are familiar with JUnit)

2. Create a simple parking application:
Implement the following classes and more if needed
     	class Parking
           methods
           - addMotoOnLastFreePlace
           - takeLastMoto
           - addMotoByPlaceNumber
           - takeMotoByPlaceNumber
           - clearGaragePlaces
           - open
           - close
           - changeAddress
           - showAllInGarage

        class MotorCycle - simple class-holder with fields such as "model" , "plateNumber" etc
         - Create a ParkingRun class with the main method containing examples of working code or create JUnit  tests ( for those who are familiar with JUnit)


  *** Think about how to make your parking more universal so that you can park any kind of vehicle
       abstract class Vehicle , concrete classes : Motorcycle, Car

(abstract class) Vehicle
          /      \
    Motorcycle      Car
